== Data Maintenance

=== Introduction

Datasets are maintained as needed and must include mechanisms for S-130
updating. Data updates will be made by new editions. The maintenance and
update frequency of S-130 datasets should be defined by the producers
implementing this specification.

Data Producers must use applicable sources to maintain and update data
and provide a brief description of the sources that were used to produce
the dataset in the appropriate metadata field.

The data product must provide information on how the data is maintained
and should describe the principles and criteria applied in maintenance
regime. This should specify the expected frequency of updates.

Since <<S100,part=17>> does not provide distinct metadata fields for data
source and production process, summarized information about these may be
included in the _comment_ field in S100_DatasetDiscoveryMetadata
(<<cls-12.2.4>>).

=== Production process for base and update datasets

Data Producers should follow their established production processes for
maintaining and updating datasets. Data is produced against the DCEG and
checked against S-158:130 Polygonal Demarcations of Global Sea Areas Data
Product Validation Checks.

=== Dataset updates and cancellation

The purpose of issue of the dataset is indicated in the "purpose" field
of the dataset discovery metadata. In order to terminate a dataset, an
update dataset file is created for which the edition number must be set
to 0. This convention is only used to cancel a base dataset file.

Where a dataset is cancelled and its name is reused at a later date, the
issue date must be greater than the issue date of the cancelled dataset.

When the dataset is cancelled it must be removed from the system.

An exchange set may contain base dataset files and update dataset files
for the same datasets. Under these circumstances the update dataset files
must follow in the correct sequential order from the last update applied
to the base dataset file.

=== Support file updates

The purpose of issue is indicated in the "purpose" field of the support
file discovery metadata. Support files carrying the "deletion" flag in
metadata must be removed from the system. When a feature or information
type pointing to a text, picture or application file is deleted or
updated so that it no longer references the file, the system software
must check to see whether any other feature or information type
references the same file, before that file is deleted.

=== Feature catalogues

For each new version of the S-130 Product Specification a new feature
catalogue will be released. The system must be able to manage datasets
and their catalogues that are created on different versions of the S-130
Product Specification.

=== Feature history, versions and change tracking

If applications or production systems require versioning of individual
instances of feature or information types, maintenance of histories, or
change tracking, the methods for versioning, history management, and
change tracking and display are left to the application or production
system.
