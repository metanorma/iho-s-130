== Metadata

[[cls-12.1]]
=== Introduction

<<S100>> provides for supplying the following categories of metadata with
<<S100>> based Exchange Sets:

* Metadata about the overall Exchange Set and the Exchange Catalogue;
* Discovery metadata about each of the datasets contained in the Exchange
Set; and
* Discovery metadata about the support files that make up the package;
* Metadata about any Feature, Portrayal, or Interoperability Catalogues
included in the Exchange Set.

In an S-100 Exchange Set, the above metadata is provided by the Exchange
Catalogue, which is an XML file containing XML blocks describing
discovery metadata for the exchange set and its components.

The discovery metadata classes described in <<S100,part=17>> have
numerous attributes which enable important information about the datasets
and accompanying support files to be examined without the need to process
the data, for example, decrypt, decompress, load, etc.
<<S100,figure="17-2">> depicts the conceptual structure of an S-100
Exchange Set and the relationships between components of the Exchange Set
and discovery metadata in the Exchange Catalogue. The Exchange Catalogue
is structured as depicted in <<S100,figure="17-6">> and
<<S100,figure="17-7">>. Detailed specifications for metadata are provided
in <<S100,clause="17-4.5">>.

This edition of S-130 implements the metadata structure and encoding
defined in <<S100,part=17>>. This Edition of S-130 does not include a
Portrayal Catalogue, does not use ISO metadata files, and does not
provide for S-130 datasets to [underline]#reference# support files. The optional
discovery metadata which <<S100,part=17>> provides for portrayal
catalogues and ISO metadata files are therefore not permitted for S-130
data.

<<cls-12.2>> provides details about the mandatory and optional metadata
for S-130.

[[cls-12.2]]
=== Elements of S-130 Exchange Catalogues

S-130 metadata in Exchange Catalogues is derived from
<<S100,figure="17-7">>, with the following restrictions:

* S-130 does not use certain optional elements and fields defined in
S-100 generic metadata. Elements that are optional in the generic S-100
catalogue model but not used in S-130 are not shown.
* S-130 makes certain optional <<S100>> elements or fields mandatory.
Elements that are optional in <<S100>> but mandatory in S-130 are shown
with the restricted multiplicity in place of that given in
<<S100,part=17>> (for example, as "1" instead of the generic "0..1") and
the restriction is noted in the Remarks column.
* S-130 imposes certain product-specific requirements on the values of
some metadata fields. These requirements are described in the Remarks
column.

In S-130 Edition 2.0.0 the only catalogues defined for S-130 products are
Feature Catalogues.

The default language used by the Exchange Catalogue may be specified in
the _defaultLocale_ field of *S100_ExchangeCatalogue* (clause 0). If
omitted, the default language is English. See
<<S100,clause="17-4.6">>--<<S100,clause="17-4.8">> for guidance on
encoding of metadata in languages other than English.

The following clauses define the mandatory and optional metadata used by
S-130. Differences from generic <<S100>> metadata are emphasized for
developer convenience in bold text in the documentation tables, and
comments noting the difference are included in the Remarks column. Where
S-130 does not impose any restrictions on the <<S100>> class, the
corresponding documentation table has been omitted from this document.

<<fig-12-1>> below depicts the detailed structure of the S-130 Exchange
Catalogue. This Figure is derived from <<S100,figure="17-7">>, modified
to omit elements (classes, attributes, and enumeration values) that are
optional in the generic <<S100>> catalogue model and not used in S-130.

[[cls-12.2.2]]
==== S100_ExchangeCatalogueIdentifier

S-130 uses S100_ExchangeCatalogueIdentifier without modification.

[[cls-12.2.3]]
==== S100_CataloguePointofContact

S-130 uses S100_CataloguePointOfContact without modification.

[[cls-12.2.4]]
==== S100_DatasetDiscoveryMetadata

S-130 restricts the multiplicity and contents of
S100_DatasetDiscoveryMetadata as described in the Remarks column in the
table below.

Dataset discovery metadata for an update dataset also uses
S100_DatasetDiscoveryMetadata. Update dataset metadata is intended to
describe information about an update dataset. It facilitates the
management and exploitation of data and is an important requirement for
understanding the characteristics of an update dataset. Whereas dataset
metadata is usually fairly comprehensive, metadata for update datasets
only describe the issue date and sequential relation to the base dataset.
Optional fields may therefore be omitted for update metadata unless
mandated in the Remarks column.

S-130 uses only the ECDSA-384-SHA2 value of
S100_SE_DigitalSignatureReference, in conformity with the restriction in
<<S100,clause="15-8.7">> and <<S100,clause="15-8.11.7">>.

|===

===== S100_SE_DigitalSignature

S-130 conforms to <<S100,clause="15-8-11.4">>, which states: "The class
S100_SE_DigitalSignature is realized as one of either
S100_SE_SignatureOnData (a digital signature of a particular identified
resource) or an additional digital signature defined using the [same
class] which is either a S100_SE_SignatureOnData or
S100_SE_SignatureOnSignature element as described in
<<S100,clause="15-8.8">>. <<S100,part=17>> metadata thus allows for
multiple digital signatures, a single mandatory S100_SE_SignatureOnData
and any number of additional signatures, either of the data or other
signatures." (In <<S100>>, this class is not documented separately.)

S-130 uses the class S100_SE_DigitalSignature without modification;
however, in S-100 exchange catalogues it is implemented by one of its
subclasses S100_SE_SignatureOnData or S100_SE_SignatureOnSignature.

===== S100_SE_SignatureOnData

S-130 uses S100_SE_SignatureOnData without modification.

===== S100_SE_SignatureOnSignature

S-130 uses S100_SE_SignatureOnSignature without modification.

===== DataStatus

S-130 uses the S-100 enumeration DataStatus defined in <<S100,part=15>>
without modification.

===== EX_GeographicBoundingBox

S-130 uses the ISO class with only the four attributes specifying the
lower left and upper right corners. The ISO _extentTypeCode_ attribute is
omitted.

NOTE: (from <<ISO19115-1>>): This is only an approximate reference so
specifying the Coordinate Reference System is unnecessary and need only
be provided with a precision of up to two decimal places.

===== EX_BoundingPolygon

S-130 uses the ISO class with only the _polygon_ attribute. The ISO
_extentTypeCode_ attribute is omitted.

NOTE: (from <<ISO19115-1>>): If a polygon is used it should be closed
(last point replicates first point).

==== S100_CatalogueDiscoveryMetadata

S-130 uses S100_CatalogueDiscoveryMetadata without modification. This
class is used to provide metadata about the Feature Catalogues if it is
included in the Exchange Set.

Since S-130 does not use portrayal or interoperability catalogues, the
corresponding values are not used in S-130. Only the _featureCatalogue_
